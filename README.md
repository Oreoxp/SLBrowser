# SLBrowser Overview
Welcome to our  open source browser project! This browser combines three core technologies, delivering the high performance and rich features expected of modern browsers.

## Key Features:

**litebrowser**: Serving as the foundation of our project, litebrowser provides a lightweight browser architecture. Its simple and efficient design allows for rapid implementation and customization of various browser functionalities. Developers can easily understand and extend litebrowser due to its streamlined structure.

**Skia**: For high-performance graphics rendering, we have chosen the Skia graphics library. Widely used in many renowned projects, Skia is known for its powerful rendering capabilities and cross-platform support. Whether it's 2D graphics or complex page layouts, Skia handles rendering tasks with exceptional efficiency, delivering a smooth visual experience to users.

**V8**: Our JavaScript engine of choice is Google's V8. One of the most advanced and popular JavaScript engines available today, V8 supports fast execution of JavaScript code, greatly enhancing the interactivity of web pages. With V8, our browser can efficiently parse and execute scripts, meeting the demands of complex web applications with ease.

## Additional Note:
This library is currently in the development stage, and the code may appear somewhat disorganized. We invite everyone to join us in learning and progressing together, contributing to the refinement and advancement of the project.

## Summary:
This open source browser project aims to provide developers with a powerful and flexible tool to quickly build and customize their own browser solutions. Whether you're developing a specialized browser for a specific application or researching and improving browser technologies, this project is your ideal choice.

Join us to explore more possibilities and collectively drive the progress of browser technology!
